## Luciana Brito

I hold a degree in physics from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, with a specialization in e-learning management. Currently, I am pursuing a master's degree in Information Systems as part of the postgraduate program in Informatics at UFRJ. My professional journey has been both diverse and dedicated. For nearly a decade, I have served as an Instructional Designer for the Rio de Janeiro State Government, and for seven years, I dedicated myself to educating students as a physics teacher within the same government institution.

Two decades ago, I embarked on my journey in the field of science education, and since then, I have remained unwavering in my pursuit of personal and professional growth. My primary aim has always been to contribute to the education of young adults, fostering their understanding of subjects like science, mathematics, physics, and their associated technologies.

One of the hallmark aspects of my research and projects is collaboration. It's essential to recognize that numerous individuals are integral to the success of the projects I engage in. Their contributions, be it in terms of creativity, support, or sheer hard work, are what fuel our collective success. We find immense fulfillment in working as a team and are committed to perpetuating this collaborative spirit, for we truly believe in the power of unity.
